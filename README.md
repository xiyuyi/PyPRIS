This is a python package for PRIS -- a progressive refinement method for sparse recovery.

## Environment Setup

PyPRIS requires installation of Anaconda.

Before running PyPRIS, create the environment by running the following code in Anaconda:

`conda env create -f PyPRIS_env.yml`

Then activate the environment with:

`conda activate PyPRIS_env`

Before running notebook files, set up the environment of Ipython kernel as well with the following code:

`ipython kernel install --user --name=PyPRIS_env`

Finally, after starting jupyter notebook, switch kernel to current environment by clicking "Kernel -> Change kernel -> PyPRIS_env".

## On Hoffman2:
Upload: upload test_data, PyPRIS, PyPRIS_env.yml and \*.py files to hoffman2 under your home directory.

#### configure environment for PyPRIS (PyPRIS_env) on Hoffman2 from terminal (recommended terminals include MobaXTerm and Putty) 
After log-in from the terminal, start an interactive session with: `qrsh` (this step may take a few minutes)

Load anaconda with:

`module load anaconda`

Install the PyPRIS_env enviroenemt to your home directory with:

`conda env create -f PyPRIS_env.yml` (This step may take about 10 minutes)

Activate the environment with:

`source activate PyPRIS_env`

To log-out from the PyPRIS environment, type: 

`conda deactivate`

### Computation on Hoffman2
* upload the observation files (for example: blur_plane1.tif, blur_plane7.tif and psf.tif in test_data) to hoffman2. keep both files under the same file folder 
* prepare tickets by updating and executing prep_for_hoffman2.py locally (recommended.)
Examples include prep_for_hoffman2_Feature2.py and prep_for_hoffman2_feature3.py
  * specify file names and file paths for each plane.
  * specify ticket.ticket_folder
  * specify index range for x,y,z dimensions (the range need to match your fov size)
  * set a wide range for bgCSF, mu, and alpha values, in the form of absolute values.
  * upload to hoffman2.
  * put in the pris and pris.Ini files into each ticket folder.
  * To ensure the pris and the ticket files are readable and executable, use `chmod -R u+rwx * `
  * **Perform Single Job test!** extremley important. test with a single job first. Because if you fail a big batch of jobs, your priority will be reduced in the queue.
      * if any error arises, open an interactive session to debug on the server by activating an interactive python session. To initiate an interactive python session from the terminal on hoffman2 (recommended to use Putty), type `Python`
      * fix bugs until a linbreg recovery can be successfully executed in the interactive session.
      * **perform single JOb test before moving on!**
      * test with `python pris` from the terminal.
  * submit batch jobs
